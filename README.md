This repository aims to reproduce the findings of the paper "[Hate is the New Infodemic: A Topic-aware Modeling of Hate Speech Diffusion on Twitter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9458789)"[1]. The model _RETINA_ (**Ret**weeter **I**dentifier **N**etwork with Exogeneous **A**ttention), a neural architecture to predict potential retweeters given a tweet, is consists of two separate process.
1) Spread as the hate generation
2) Retweet diffusion of hate

This model identifies multiple key factors that govern the dissemination of hate.
